INTRODUCTION
We aim to create a text-based minigame which tells the story of a Hero and a Girl. The player is able to choose between the Hero or the Girl. During the journey, they will encounter multiple decisions, and each will lead to a different ending. Player can learn about the story and the characters in different ways by playing through various endings.
